1)Difference between HTML, HTML5, CSS and JAVA Script
HTML: The basic markup language for structuring web pages (e.g., headings, paragraphs, links).

HTML5: The latest version of HTML with new features like semantic tags, multimedia elements, and APIs.

CSS: Styles and designs the appearance of HTML elements (e.g., colors, fonts, layouts).

JavaScript: A programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages (e.g., handling events, animations).

2)Difference between span and div

The main differences between <span> and <div> are their usage and how they affect the layout of a webpage:

<div> (Division)
Type: Block-level element.
Usage: Used to group larger sections of content or elements together. Commonly used for layout purposes.
Behavior: Takes up the full width available (from left to right) and starts on a new line.
Example:
html
Copy code
<div>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Some content in a paragraph.</p>
</div>
<span>
Type: Inline-level element.
Usage: Used to group small pieces of text or elements within a line, often for applying styles or scripting.
Behavior: Does not start on a new line; it only takes up as much width as necessary, staying within the flow of surrounding text.
Example:
html
Copy code
<p>This is a <span style="color: red;">red word</span> in a sentence.</p>
Summary:
<div>: Block-level, used for larger sections, starts on a new line.
<span>: Inline-level, used for smaller pieces of content within a line, stays in the flow of text.
