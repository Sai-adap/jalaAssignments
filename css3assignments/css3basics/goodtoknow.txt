***Importance of HTML DOCTYPE?
     The <!DOCTYPE> declaration in HTML is important because it informs the web browser about the version of HTML being used,
    which in turn determines how the browser should render the page. It helps trigger "standards mode," 
    ensuring that the page is displayed according to modern web standards, avoiding "quirks mode," which emulates older, 
    non-standard behaviors for compatibility with outdated web content. In HTML5, the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is used, 
    and it's essential for consistent and predictable rendering across different browsers.
