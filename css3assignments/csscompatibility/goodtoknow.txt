Understand table structure?
In HTML, a table is used to organize data into rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet. The table structure is composed of several key elements that define the layout and content of the table. Here's a detailed breakdown of the table structure in HTML:

Basic Table Structure
A basic HTML table is made up of the following elements:

<table>: The container for all table-related elements.
<thead>: The table header, which contains the headings of the columns.
<tbody>: The body of the table, where the actual data rows are placed.
<tfoot>: The table footer, often used for summary rows.
<tr>: A table row, used to group table cells into a single row.
<th>: A table header cell, which defines the header of a column or row.
<td>: A table data cell, which contains the data for a specific cell in the table.

Explain cell padding and cell spacing.
Cell Padding
Definition: The space between the content of a cell and its border.
Purpose: Adds space inside the cell, making the content less cramped.
CSS Property: padding.
Cell Spacing
Definition: The space between the borders of adjacent cells.
Purpose: Creates a gap between cells, making the table look more open.
CSS Property: border-spacing.

What are form attributes?
Here's a short summary of form attributes:

action: URL to send form data.
method: HTTP method (GET or POST).
enctype: Data encoding type (e.g., multipart/form-data for file uploads).
target: Where to display the response (_self, _blank, etc.).
name: Name of the form.
autocomplete: Enables/disables auto-completion (on or off).
novalidate: Disables form validation.
accept-charset: Character encodings accepted by the server.
