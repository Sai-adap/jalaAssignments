***What is a box model?
The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in web design that describes how elements are structured and displayed on a webpage. Understanding the box model is crucial for accurately controlling the layout, spacing, and alignment of elements.

Components of the Box Model
Each element on a web page is considered a rectangular box, which is composed of four parts:

Content
Padding
Border
Margin
Here’s a breakdown of each component:

1. Content
Definition: This is the innermost part of the box where the actual content (text, images, etc.) resides.
Dimensions: The width and height of this area are controlled by the width and height properties.
2. Padding
Definition: Padding is the space between the content and the border of the box. It creates extra space inside the element around the content.
Dimensions: Controlled by the padding property, which can be set for all sides or individually for top, right, bottom, and left (padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, padding-left).
3. Border
Definition: The border wraps around the padding (if any) and the content. It’s a visible line or a series of lines that define the edges of the box.
Dimensions: Controlled by the border property (e.g., border-width, border-style, border-color). Borders can be different on each side or uniform around the box.
4. Margin
Definition: Margin is the outermost space that separates the box from other elements on the page. It creates space outside the border.
Dimensions: Controlled by the margin property, which can be set individually or for all sides (margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left).
